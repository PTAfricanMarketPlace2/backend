<h2> The Pitch:</h2>
    * Sauti Africa empowers small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and economic opportunities to grow out of poverty.

The use of this app will:

    * enable these users (business owners) to create a listing for items they have for sale.

    * allow a user to log onto the site and see various categories to help them set their own prices.

    * allow the user to make listings for what they want to sell, which can be seen by all users.

    * allow the user to add a new item by selecting their makrket location and then typing in their item name, description and price.

<h2>Backend Developer(Node) Objectives:
    * The API should provide the endpoints that the front end needs to complete client requirements and demonstrate your proficiency in the skills you've learned so far.

    * The API should be built using the REST architectural pattern, provide data persistence, incorporate authentication, include automated tests and be deployed to a hosting platform of your choice.
