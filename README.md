<h2> Project Overview</h2>

    * Sauti Africa empowers small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business 
        and economic opportunities to grow out of poverty.

    The use of this app will:

    + enable these users (business owners) to create a listing for items they have for sale.

    + allow a user to log onto the site and see various categories to help them set their 
        own prices.

    + allow the user to make listings for what they want to sell, which can be seen by all 
        users.

    + allow the user to add a new item by selecting their makrket location and then typing 
        in their item name, description and price.

<h2> Objectives:</h2>

    * The API should provide the endpoints that the front end needs to complete client 
        requirements and demonstrate your proficiency in the skills you've learned so far.

    * The API should be built using the REST architectural pattern, provide data persistence,
         incorporate authentication, include automated tests and be deployed to a hosting 
         platform of your choice.
